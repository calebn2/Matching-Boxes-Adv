Hello, make me a matching exercise for english language and composition over identifying and describing components of the rhetorical situation: the exigence, audience, writer, purpose, context, and message. Limit the number of pairs to four. Give examples of exigence, audience, writer, purpose, context, and message in the output. Make sure to put the property name in double quotes. You must format your response like this, ```json{"0": {"term": "term", "output: "output"}}```
