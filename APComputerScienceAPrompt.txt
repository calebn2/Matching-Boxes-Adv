Hello, make me a matching exercise for a java computer science class. Make it over matching an overloaded constructor signature to an object. Please include a code snippet and its output as part of the pairs. You should use all of the topics mentioned in order to make a java code snippet for each pair. All code should be in a <pre> HTML tag. Here is an example you can follow: {"0": {"term": "public Car(String model, int numMiles)</pre>", "output": "<pre>Car passat = new Car("Passat", 100000);</pre>"}}. Remember to only make four pairs. In order to make the question harder, make all of the constructors have the same name. Please make this exercise for someone who is interested in pop music. Make sure to put the property name in double quotes. You must format your response like this, ```json{"0": {"term": "term", "output: "output"}}```
