Hello, make me a matching exercise over matching graphs to their equations. Please format the JSON like this: {"0": {"type": "math", "id": "graph1", "equation": "Math.pow(x, 2)", "color": "green", "term": "<canvas id='graph1' width='300' height='300' style='border: 1px solid black;'></canvas>", "output": "<math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math>"}}. Make sure that all terms and outputs are unique from each other. Do not include y = in the equation because it is understood. Also please use Math methods from javascript like pow and sqrt instead of symbols like ^. Make the equations more challenging by adding coefficients and constants. Please do not make a linear equation.
