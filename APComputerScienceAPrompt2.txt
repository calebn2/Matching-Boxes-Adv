Hello, make me a matching exercise for a java AP Computer Science A class. There should be a central stimulus of an array of strings; make sure the array is at least 20 elements long. The student must match for loops that traverse the array to their outputs. Please include a code snippet and its output as part of the pairs. You should use all of the topics mentioned in order to make a java code snippet for each pair. All code should be in a <pre> HTML tag. Here is an example you can follow: {“0”: {“term”: “<pre>”, “output”: “<pre>”}}. Remember to only make four pairs. Please make this exercise for someone who is interested in pop music. Make sure to put the property name in double quotes. Put the array as a stimulus at the beginning so that you do not have to declare it on every single pair. Do not declare new arrays in the pairs. In the for-loop arguments, have a diversity of traversal methods
